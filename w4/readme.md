# learn_together w4
    In this learn_together, I wanted to replicate the decision making process I usuaully go through in the morning before work. I teach at a high school, and on certain days I have a prep period that allows me the flexibility to go to my favorite coffee shop for a bit of a break. With this in mind, I focused on the decisions that impact my commute as well as my spending habits.

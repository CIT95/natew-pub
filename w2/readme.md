# Possible Project Idea

    One of the things that interests me most about data science and analytics is how it can be utilized to make sense of sporting events. Specifically, I am intrigued by how computers and math can be used to make sense of seemingly random outcomes in soccer. The intersection of data analytics and sports is common knowledge and made popular through the film Moneyball, but I think soccer presents an even more complex patchwork of events and data that must be understood correctly to make predictions or just to make sense of what goes on in a game. With all of that said, I would like to work on a project that takes in data from past games to predict possible outcomes in a specific match. To do this successfully may be beyond the scope of what I will learn in this class, but based on some preliminary research, it seems like many of the concepts discussed so far in these first two days could be used to make simple predictions. Hopefully this type of project fits within the parameters of the dev work we will be completing.

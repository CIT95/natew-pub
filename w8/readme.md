## Expense Tracker
    I decided to switch gears and try something different than my Week 4 learn_together project. Here I used lists within a dictionary to keep track of expenses based on categories. I started with some general catergories and then allowed the user to add new categories. The user was able to then add expenses to the categories and then run the final total spending.
